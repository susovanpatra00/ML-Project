# The __init__.py file is an essential part of a Python package. It serves several important functions:
#
# Package Initialization: The presence of an __init__.py file in a directory indicates to Python that it should 
#                         consider the directory as a package, which can contain multiple modules (Python files). 
#                         This is a signal for the Python interpreter.
# Namespace Packages: It can be left empty or be used to define what symbols the package exports, which subpackages 
#                     or modules should be imported when from package import * is used, or to set up package-level 
#                     variables.
# Code Execution: Any code that is written in the __init__.py file gets executed when the package is imported. 
#                 This can be used for package setup or initialization code that you want to run once when the 
#                 package is first imported.
